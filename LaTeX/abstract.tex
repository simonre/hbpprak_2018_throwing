We present our work done on the Neuro Robotics Platform (NRP) to solve the throwing challenge. The aim of the challenge is to use learning techniques to make a robot arm throw a cylinder as far as possible inside the NRP simulation. We took three main approaches: letting the robot arm hit the cylinder away, grabbing the cylinder and throwing it, and grabbing the cylinder, winding up and then throwing it. The learning techniques used were an evolutionary algorithm and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo inspired / hillclimbing algorithm.
