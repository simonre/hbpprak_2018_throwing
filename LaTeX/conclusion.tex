\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

We presented several approaches to solve the problem.
The evolutionary algorithm yielded satisfying results. However, the movements were not realistic and probably impossible to execute in the real world. On the other hand, the MCMC approach was severely limited by not being able to recover well from one-time glitches in the physics simulation.
Although a neural-network-based approach would certainly be interesting, we decided to test out alternative approaches because of the platform limitations.
